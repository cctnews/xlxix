	13、生活中的言语很神奇，有时长说不如短说，有时短说不如不说，有时多说不如少说，有时正说不如反说，有时当面说不如背后说。
　　这个团是泰山青岛烟台瑶池5晚4日游，1000一人，两黄昏在列车上过，三黄昏在宾馆住。黄昏我两在北京站会见后，踏上了开赴山东的列车。列车启用后我的情绪发端放飞，仍旧飞到了山东。不是憧憬看到山东的时髦得意，是什么不说你也领会。
厥后秀儿出门处事。我越职代理，替她卖起了装束。大概是我的观念不同凡响吧!动作引导购物员，我是帮主顾抉择装束的，而不是站在东家的态度上甩卖。主顾纷繁涌入店里，交易极为红火。我也被破格扶助，走到前台扶助秀儿做正儿八经的交易来。从那此后，交战越来越多，我发觉犹如离不开她。每天看落日，秀儿假如不去，发觉内心一片空荡荡的。也风气她朗诵笔墨的声调。一次我很早就到达了桥堍，等了长久。不见她的影子，我想她不会来了。发迹要走的功夫，瞥见她转过街口，急遽赶来。犹如犯错似的，积极抱歉。而后说：你有女伙伴吗?我不妨一辈子守在你的身边吗?这无疑是暴风骤雨。窈窕的身体，洒脱的长发，芳华的滋味。我哪有如许的艳福。秀儿也太轻率了，大概咱们都是飘荡的本土人。此时我是她的依附，果然把终身委派给我，而我保证不了给她快乐。纵然调配处事，所获也是无济于事。我陈列许多来由，她老是不觉得然。

To buy things to sell, earn the money back, also put the money in the gold officer street expenditure.
The street day, cheerful voices of the people here are people mountain people sea.
A small street, cheerful voices of people one by one, packed.
Walking in the street, you don't know how to walk, sometimes squeezed so feet are not touchdown, let a person to walk.
In winter, is the country in the day, more cheerful voices.
Year the Spring Festival, every day to the man in the street every day more than forty thousand, gold officer in each lane of the street, crowded people everywhere.
We cannot describe officer this cheerful voices on the wonders of ancient gold, it is hard to say that the gold officer why will have this peculiar phenomenon of cheerful voices.
I haven't even at the age of 20, are often in jin guan town on business.
I often go to business family name is van, people call him LaoFan.
LaoFan is an old car, he was the son of nu river highway with me.
LaoFan lived in a town of pages, there is a old well the door.
Also don't know when was it built, wellhead is square, not as well elsewhere, wellhead is round.
The whole three sichuan dam, and the people in the street called it a "four square well".
The quartet Wells and there was a big banyan tree, all the year round.
Well water is strong, the whole street, eat it in the water.
LaoFan is sichuan people, gold officer at horse town home.
LaoFan one eye blind, he said are animals playing blind horse.
LaoFan eye is bad, but the account is clear, each time he and I do business, he has not eaten a loss, of course, I think he didn't let me eat a loss.
LaoFan home business, and I are made by I go to the mountain to following forest products, from retail LaoFan house in the street.
I also know that the goods to LaoFan to pin, cheaper in price, but if I go to the streets to sell, but also sold less than LaoFan to my price.
So, up to now, I have to thank LaoFan, is he taught me the business, taught me life.
When I was doing business in LaoFan home, the quartet Wells had drowned, heard that is a caravan, jumped Wells because of a nervous breakdown.
At that time, I sometimes had trouble with business goes wrong.
I said to LaoFan and his son, we are in trouble, everyone has a heart sad who didn't, but how do we is not nervous?
LaoFan and his son listened to talk to me all feel funny, regard me as their good friends.
Beside the square hole, there is a open shop, people know his name, called his boss.
When I arrived at the LaoFan home, often to his shop to buy a pack of cigarettes, a bag of a match or something.
The boss old caravan is, listen to the accents like Dali.
I wanna ask LaoFan, where are the boss, LaoFan never told why.
LaoFan said only that the boss from young horse, has been rushed to the eve of liberation.
All the boss before liberation is to help somebody else's horse, all year round on the road, no field.
After the liberation of land reform, boss became small class, belong to the management of supply and marketing cooperatives, and then into the street to open a shop.
The people on the street he was called "club", "social" means: cooperative cadres.
Cooperatives of cadres, the years is very popular.
At that time, to buy tea, buy soap have to supply the proof, it is conceivable that how big is the power of the "social" hand.
So, I think the boss shop that a few years, as the horse.
Than the boss always do business on the street, when I was his horse know the street market, businessmen are familiar with, and also the street to the street business, and is handy.
Than when they are in the horse can't marry daughter-in-law, to open a shop, but found a woman more than twenty years younger than he is.
Street head, say there are a lot than the boss, he was driven cattle, have lover in driving on the road is, to the old, and married the beautiful young woman.
This is to let a person envy and jealousy.
Unfortunately, the boss to die sooner than daughter-in-law, boss die, daughter-in-law was fifty years old.
Wan boss afraid daughter-in-law difficult to cross the lonely day after his death, a part from their savings, for daughter-in-law bought a bicycle (at that time, there are relatively few people bike on the street).
Daughter-in-law learning for half a year to learn the bicycle, ride all day running in sanchuan bazi, officer walking up and down the street, in gold moved through the lonely time.
Boss daughter-in-law will ride a bike, but I can't shake bell (may be cycling are not familiar with, can not afford time to wave), the car on the road, far away Shouting passerby: "sister, let the car to car" or shout: "brother, let the car".
The other day I went to the gold officer ancient town, the whole three sichuan, the whole gold officer of the people of the streets, all remember once-ler this old car, have a man riding a bicycle to shout to the old lady.
Four sides under the well, there is a snack.
Food pavilion is SMC, surprisingly, become a chef, is also an old caravan, called de-gui Yang.
Lao Yang people thin, often in mouth diao a white smoke, wore a blue cloth gown, chest with white poster paint a 006 "SCM" a few words.
At that time, not many people to afford to eat in the food hall, a pavilion, the whole street is very light.
Gold officer of the people of the streets, there is some money, occasionally feeding pavilion, but food home do, meat to eat in.
Lao Yang's meat, it is a good fire, in a big porcelain bowl.
Buy meat, can buy a set, also can buy half plate.
I remember, a plate is four and a half cents, only take two hair, very comfortable, hui.
When I was a kid down the street, I like to snack hall door to aim at east west at toms.
And it had no meaning in the village, went to the king the street, the street every things in the salesroom was seen countless times.
Don't have a cent to the street, hand, down the street to just go sightseeing.
To snacks pavilion looks, but also took to the streets in a content, did not think at that time see snack hall, also can enter into my articles.
I think of, at the time was feeding pavilion, most are some horses, catch the carriage.
Feed horses, hanging the cattle from the pavilion on the door on the top of the pole, then set on the head of the cattle feed pockets, a horse mounts a small pocket, let them eat slowly, they confidently into the pavilion.
Driven carriage, food pavilion had pulled the door, parking, good feeding cattle, also sit in the food hall.
I envy those who catch the carriage, wearing a Dali made in white hat, straw hat also with flowers on the top, below the straw hat, with blue, white for ribbon.
Lao Yang caravan and are familiar with, greeting with the caravan is very loud, and his lips that cigarettes, and when people say "hello", also not down, a shake a shake on the mouth.
Most of the time, the caravan to Lao Yang also to drink a glass of wine, business spare, Lao Yang also compensate for a drink.
Caravan drank the wine, more words, snack hall like quarrel, very interesting.
On the gold officer ancient town, the old horse, I don't know, most of them young horses, I have a friend named Wang Guogui, people called him "old you" on the street.
Old your father is also a horse man, so, old feeds his horse on your helping his father at an early age, put your horse.
Over time, older you wanted to the horse, and don't want to read a book.
Said, his home was old your father take you to hurt, let him as a child to feed horses, their horse and horse strong feelings.
Old your bad grades, KaoXue does not, with no state of mind, there is no way, home had to the old your wishes, let old you catch up the cattle.
The horse was to help teams, bitter point.
Catch a horse is not a few years, however, by 1981, fixing, the two older you bought him a horse cattle, runs his own up.
Communities depend, eat street by street.
Your old horse, no longer only bitter point, carry food to sell, carry meters to sell, what change carry what, money into every day.
Saved a little money, older you to sell the horse again, and in a walking tractor.
At that time, the policy is open, many people haven't turn around, even for what he bought tractor I have some doubt, doubt what he did is in line with the policy.
But your old tractor drive quite well, cargo out during the day, in the evening dress up his tractor.
Smartened up his tractor always, wipe very clean body car head, arm also often tied with a towel.
In my impression, he also welding tractor on a small iron cage, containing a drink boiled water in the glass bottle, bottle and a plastic thread woven outside of the condom.
Since opened tractors, old expensive clothes wear clean up, to catch the horse wear double-breasted garment in the body, put on his jacket, and he and his horse.
Old out quite well a walking tractor, policy is not changed, and the better.
A lot of people just follow old expensive to buy a tractor, walking tractor up more on the street.
Walking tractor and difficult to change, the old tractor you'll convert into a big car.
The expensive car is "kunming" brand, is gold officer soho's first big car on the street.
First big car and, of course, can change most, old expensive and enviable people on the street.
I just feel not old your reading, the total is better than me.
But his horse, drive are stronger than me, thinking agile, too.
Reform and opening-up over the past few years, he always do right, he can always go to the front of the person.
The caravan to gold officer street interviews, I choose to go to the snack hall de-gui Yang, de-gui Yang is dead.
To find your old again.
Old you also didn't drive a big car, buy a car after a run of kunming, specially Larkin officer businessmen to kunming to shipment.
One day, old your out of the car in kunming, I ask the ask the man in the street, they said, your old very co-opting, customers are always more than other cars.
In his car, regular customers have preferential, season off-season is a price, the guest loading the goods, he has to help the family, willing to endure hardship.
I want to, old your past is just a horse, culture is not high also, but how can always adapt to the social this big market?
Hear people say, his home, brother, sister and brother-in-law, the whole family are all drivers, are living on driving.
The street people also said that if not liberation, they were probably horse.
Originally, the person's life is the most crucial capital is kung fu, rather than money.
For some, the price is not chronological is money.
Take a stake in the center of the care about to join the output ratio, determine your balance results can not cost rate, but your mindset and damage resistance ability.
A common people, how to make profit to maximize my life?
Some advocacy: take a stake in himself, to give himself inflatable, in interpersonal contact, this different is now and in the future will not lack.
There is no shortcut to survive, rely on our own hands to create, not stretch out his hand to.
